Created a simple C program that reads from a .wav file, applies a lowpass IIR filter, and outputs the new audio signal to an output file. Used libsndfile http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/ library to read and write to WAV file.

Generate with "make" ; creates lpf file.

Used for testing before C++ implementation in JUCE.
